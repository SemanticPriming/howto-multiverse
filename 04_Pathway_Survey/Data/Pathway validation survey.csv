Semantic Priming Multiverse Expert Consensus Survey

 

You are invited to be in a research study about how you process reaction time or response latency data. You should have experience in semantic priming or working with reaction time data. We ask that you read this form and ask any questions you may have before agreeing to be in the study.

 

This study is being conducted by Dr. Erin M. Buchanan, Professor of Cognitive Analytics at Harrisburg University of Science and Technology.



Background Information:

In the entire study, you will complete two expert surveys about how reaction time data is processed, one of which you already filled in. You will provide information about how you process reaction time data for analysis.

 

Procedures:

You will take this study entirely online from a desktop or laptop computer with a keyboard. You will be given an opportunity to provide your email to be involved in the final publication. The entire study should take less than thirty minutes to complete.



Risks and Benefits of being in the Study:

We will collect your email to contact you about the final manuscript. This information will initially be stored with the survey data, such that we can also contact you if we have any questions about your response and to better monitor data quality. Afterwards, we will remove your contact information such that any responses that may identify you will be anonymized before data sharing. No associated risks are expected for participating in the study.



You may benefit from being in the study by your inclusion on the final manuscript. Please note, you will need to comment/approve the final draft to ensure adherence to typical CRediT requirements.

 

Compensation:

No compensation is provided for this study.

 

Confidentiality and Data Sharing:

Measures are taken to ensure that all information you provide will be anonymous. The data from this project will be posted publicly for other researchers to use; however, no data will be directly linked to you. Your name or other identifying information will not be entered into the dataset and no references will be made in verbal or written reports that could link you to the study. In any publication, information will be provided in such a way that you cannot be identified.



Before your data are shared outside the research team, any potentially identifying information will be removed. The anonymous data may be shared with other researchers, for both related and unrelated research purposes in the future. Your anonymous data may also be made available in online data repositories such as the Open Science Framework (which are free data repositories that require registration to have access), which allow other researchers and interested parties to access the data for further analysis.

 

Voluntary Nature of the Study:

Participation in this study is voluntary:

Your decision whether to participate will not affect your current or future relations with Harrisburg University of Science and Technology or your local institution. If you decide to participate, you are free to not answer any question or withdraw at any time without affecting those relationships.

 

Contacts and Questions:

The researchers conducting this study are Dr. Erin M. Buchanan in partnership with the Psychological Science Accelerator. You may ask any questions you have now. If you have questions later, you are encouraged to contact Dr. Erin M. Buchanan at ebuchanan@harrisburgu.edu or the SPAML team at 007spaml@gmail.com.  

 

Questions or Concerns:

This study has been reviewed by Harrisburg University of Science and Technology’s Institutional Review Board (IRB).  The IRB has determined that this study fulfills the human research subject protections obligations required by state and federal law and University policies.

Another option would be to fit a model with language-separate, yet correlated, slopes for the effect of priming. This can be done with Bayesian modeling. Assuming you have a column in your data `primed`, indicating if a trial was primed or not, you can use the formula (in brms-style): RT ~ 0 + language + language:primed + (0 + language + language:primed|item) + (1 + primed|subject).

Then do further inspections of probability distributions using bucket plots and warm plots. Then run GAMLSS modelling over one or two distributions with good fits, run stepwise regression (along with some ML algorithms) and compare models.
In parallel, and in the spirit of multiverse analysis, I'd do quantile regression and robust approaches.
In all cases, I'd rely heavily on EDA techniques. 
Perhaps my last resort would be RT elimination and RT non-linear transformations (e.g. Box-Cox transformation). Linear transformations such as robust z-transformations (i.e. robust z-score = (xi - Mdn) / MAD). Outlier elimination would be a last resort.","Alternative approach, namely:",examining the variability in random effects in general and for countries... the 'gstudy' function in the R package 'gtheory' can help with this,"Yes, namely:",from a traditional parametric approach to a robust or distributional regression approach,High,High
